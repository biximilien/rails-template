# Rails Template ðŸ’Ž

My Ruby on Rails web application boilerplate with my preferred dependencies all
pre-installed. This is great to save time on new projects by installing
everything automagically.

Inspired by and loosely based on Matt Brictson's amazing Ruby on Rails
application template [mattbrictson/rails-template][orig-rails-template]. Have
a look at it!

## How to use

Generate a new application using my template

```sh
rails new AmazingApp \
  -d postgresql \
  -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biximilien/rails-template/master/template.rb
```

## Install

Add the following lines to your `~/.railsrc` if you want all your new projects
to source my template.

```sh
-d postgresql
-m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biximilien/rails-template/master/template.rb
```
